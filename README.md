# Distributed Data Analysis on Flights Data

This repository serves as the source code for the the assignment submission of the Distributed Data Analysis module as part of our Data Science and Analytics masters programm at Brunel University London.

The project involves collecting flight data from ADB-S database, and doing heavy exploratory analysis and modeling on the flights of Ukraine and its neighboring countries with the aim of investigating the effect of russian invasion on aviation traffic.

The data query results are to be placed in the `query_resutls` folder, which due to github storage limitations, cannot be commited to this repository.

If you're interested in contributing or gaining access to our dataset, which includes worldwide aviatoin data from 2016-2024, feel free to email any of the contributors.
